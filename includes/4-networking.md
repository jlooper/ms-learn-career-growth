## Join a user group or meetup

A great way to network with your local developers is by joining user groups and meetups in your locale. Often, you can find mentors and opportunities for growth by interacting with your local communities. If you don't find a meetup that aligns with your technical expertise, consider starting one. This is a great way to demonstrate your leadership abilities.
## Attend conferences

While conferences can be a financial burden for some companies or individuals, many have gone online and are thereby free of charge. List some conferences in your field that seem interesting and see if your colleagues recommend them. Ask your manager if you can attend, and make sure to watch the sessions. 

Conferences are an amazing way to discover new things and network in the 'hallway track'. While it's harder to network in purely online conferences, many events do try to offer social opportunities, so take advantage of them.

If you are very shy, attend an event such as this with a 'wingperson'. Soon, you will feel more comfortable in the environment and, who knows, some day you can become a conference speaker on stage!
## Find a mentor

Some companies provide a formal mentorship program, while others do not. Find a mentor by cultivating personal relationships within your department at work, or attend company events that will give you access to new groups of people with whom you do not work. 

Don't be shy to ask someone to be your mentor, but be aware that it involves a time commitment on both your parts. Consider asking your manager if you can take time for mentorship, if it's not built into your daily work by the company. Consider setting parameters collaboratively with your mentor, agreeing to meet for a given number of hours each month for a given number of months.

You can also find mentors outside of your company. Attend community meetups and network locally to see if you can acquire a mentor externally. You can then meet with them off-hours, or even online.
